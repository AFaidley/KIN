# KIN: Knowledge in Numbers

## Description

Knowledge in Numbers is an a social networking platform for people to connect over difficult life circumstances and experiences. The goal is to provide a safe space for people to share their story and connect with those going through something similar.

The motivation for this project is to create a meaningful application for people to benefit in mental and emotional health. Mental illness awareness is on the rise, and there is a greater need for resources that reach a broad range of people. We created this application with the hope that this can help people feel more connected to their community.
